Some of my works on Arduino IDE
I am a Mechatronic Engineering student, from the University of Port Harcourt. Nigeria. I am graduating 2024.
I love embedded systems and programming 
I have also worked on PLC's (Allen bradley) and i know how to write even complicated ladder logic diagrams 
I want to explore more on Robotics and Automations. ❤️
